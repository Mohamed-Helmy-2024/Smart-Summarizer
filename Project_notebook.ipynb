      "A data warehouse is a database designed for analytics, providing a central repository of integrated data for a single source of truth. Unlike operational systems, it focuses on analysis, powering dashboards, reports, and models. Key benefits include a consistent view of information and an integrated view for more comprehensive reporting, allowing for a better understanding of customers. Data cleaning and transformation are essential, accomplished through ETL (extract, transform, load) or ELT (extract, load, transform) processes. Data warehouses often use a star schema, organizing data with a central fact table and supporting dimension tables. Increasingly, data warehouses are moving to the cloud due to affordability, scalability, and availability.\n",
